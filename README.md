  ## 3. Camera Usage

  - **Camera images are processed instantly** and are never saved or stored
  - **Barcode data is only used** to search for nutrition information
  - **No photos are retained** after the barcode scan completes
  - **You can deny camera access** and still use all other features of the app

  ---

  ## 4. Third-Party Services

  ### 4.1 OpenFoodFacts API

  When you search for foods using the app's database search feature, we query the **OpenFoodFacts** public database to find nutrition information.

  - **What's sent:** Your search query (e.g., "chicken breast") or barcode number
  - **What's NOT sent:** Your personal data, device info, or usage patterns
  - **OpenFoodFacts Privacy:** OpenFoodFacts is a non-profit, open-source project. View their privacy policy at
  [openfoodfacts.org/privacy](https://world.openfoodfacts.org/privacy)

  - Advertising networks
  - Social media SDKs
  - Crash reporting services
  - Cloud storage or backup services

  ---

  ## 5. How We Use Your Information

  Since all your data stays on your device, we don't "use" your information—**you do**. The app uses your locally stored data to:

  - Display your food logs and nutrition summaries
  - Calculate total calories and macros for each day
  - Show your progress toward daily goals
  - Generate charts and historical views
  - Populate your custom food library

  **All processing happens on your device.** We have no access to this data.

  ---

  ## 6. Data Storage and Security

  ### 6.1 Local Storage

  - All data is stored using Apple's SwiftData framework
  - Data is encrypted by iOS when your device is locked (device-level encryption)
  - Data is isolated to the EasyCals app and cannot be accessed by other apps

  ### 6.2 Backups

  - If you use iCloud Backup or iTunes Backup, your EasyCals data may be included in your device backups
  - These backups are controlled by Apple, not by us
  - We recommend keeping device backups enabled to prevent data loss

  ### 6.3 Data Deletion

  - **Deleting the app** permanently removes all your data from your device
  - **There is no recovery** if you delete the app without backing up your device
  - We cannot recover your data because we never had access to it

  ---

  ## 7. Data Sharing and Disclosure

  **We do not share, sell, rent, or trade your data with anyone** because we don't have access to it. Your data stays on your device.

  ### Exceptions

  We may be required to disclose information if required by law, such as:

  - Responding to valid legal requests (subpoenas, court orders)
  - Protecting our legal rights or complying with legal obligations

  **However**, because we don't collect or store your data, we have nothing to disclose in most scenarios.

  ---

  ## 8. Children's Privacy

  EasyCals is not directed to children under 13 years of age. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13.

  Parents and guardians should supervise their children's use of nutrition tracking apps and consult healthcare professionals for guidance on children's dietary
  needs.

  ---

  ## 9. International Users

  EasyCals can be used anywhere in the world. Since all data is stored locally on your device:

  - Your data is subject to the privacy laws of your country/region
  - No data is transferred internationally because no data leaves your device
  - For EU users: We comply with GDPR by design (data minimization, local storage)

  ---

  - **Access:** You can view all your data within the app at any time
  - **Modification:** You can edit or update any entry in the app
  - **Deletion:** You can delete individual entries or delete the entire app to remove all data
  - **Portability:** Currently, there is no built-in export feature, but all data is stored locally on your device
